/**
 * DB-agnostic account-delete cascade algorithm — mirrors `migrationPlan.ts`'s
 * split (docs/design/account-chat-crud-spec.md §5.4): the minimal
 * `AccountDeleteDriver` interface a SQLite driver must satisfy, and the one
 * `runAccountDeleteCascade` algorithm that runs against ANY driver.
 * Production wires this to Drizzle/expo-sqlite (see
 * src/features/accounts/repository.ts's `deleteAccountCascade`, which is NOT
 * Node-testable — it imports the native DB client); the plain-Node BDD suite
 * wires it to `node:sqlite`, so the EXACT same algorithm — same ordering, same
 * transaction/rollback semantics — runs against a real SQLite engine in
 * tests, not a hand-rolled fake.
 *
 * Sequence (spec §5.4), NOT itself wrapped in a single SQL transaction end to
 * end — a forced backup is file I/O (an iCloud upload in production), which
 * can't be part of a SQLite `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`:
 *  1. `forcePreDeleteBackup()` — a forced snapshot BEFORE any destructive
 *     statement runs, so CLAUDE.md guardrail #1's round-trip can restore the
 *     pre-delete world even if the delete itself succeeds. Runs unconditionally,
 *     never skipped/throttled the way the opportunistic auto-backup is.
 *  2. `transaction(fn)` — the actual destructive delete, wrapped in ONE
 *     database transaction (parameterised, guardrail #4): delete every
 *     transaction row referencing the account, delete the recurring series
 *     LIVE-referencing it, clear every payee's learned default account that
 *     points at it (payees.default_account_id → NULL, so no payee remembers
 *     an account that no longer exists), delete the account row itself. A
 *     throw anywhere in
 *     `fn` rolls back the WHOLE transaction — no partial delete is ever left
 *     behind.
 *
 * TOCTOU fix (QA MINOR follow-up): recurring series are deleted via a driver
 * method that re-reads which series reference the account INSIDE the
 * transaction (`deleteRecurringSeriesReferencingAccount`) — NEVER a fixed id
 * list snapshotted before step 1's (potentially slow, real I/O) backup. A
 * series created during that backup window still gets caught, because the
 * "which series reference this account" decision happens live, at delete
 * time, not at snapshot time.
